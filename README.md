# DSA in C

A repository dedicated to learning Data Structures and Algorithms implemented purely in C.

## 🧠 The Difference
- **Data Structures** are how data is *organized* (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees).
- **Algorithms** are the *steps* to manipulate that data (e.g., Sorting, Searching).

## 📝 Philosophy
Learn by building. Understand memory, pointers, and efficiency through implementation.

*One struct at a time.*
