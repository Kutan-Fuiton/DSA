// Breadth First Search (BFS):- 

// -- In BFS, we start with a node and start exploring its connected nodes. The same process is repeated with all the connecting nodes until all the nodes are visited

// a concept -- BFS Spanning Tree:-
//
// -- Consider the graph shown at the right!
// -- We can start with any source node
// -- Lets start with 0
// -- Try to construct a tree with 0 as the root
// -- Mark all the sideways or duplicate edges (above a node) as dashed
